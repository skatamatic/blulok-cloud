Rather than having to read a whole bunch of code to grasp core architecture, there's a collection of documents found in /cursorDocs that you are to read and maintain as we make changes.  Be diligent in doing so to avoid costly architectural divergence and confusion.

Always adhere strictly SOLID principles and best practices
Do not allow files to become monolithic, refactor constantly and tidy as you go
Avoid duplicate code - be diligent and organized and look for opportunities to reuse/refactor code
Security for this project as of utmost importance - it is for a remotely controllable storage facility locking system.  Always use best practices for secure communications and storage, and do not use deprecated packages

Front end
---------
The UI design is minimalist and clean.  The company theme colors are 147FD4 and 050505 (blue and white)
Always consider support for themeing everything.  We will support at least light/dark modes and all components should look great in either
High aesthetic is needed.  Include snappy professional animations, hover states, click states, etc.  Attention to detail is key.

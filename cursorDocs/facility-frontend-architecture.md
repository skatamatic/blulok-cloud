# Facility Frontend Architecture

## Overview

The facility management frontend provides a comprehensive, hierarchical view of the storage facility ecosystem with intuitive navigation and smart cross-linking between related data. The system is designed with a beautiful, modern UI that showcases the facility hierarchy while maintaining excellent user experience.

## Hierarchical Data Structure

```
Facility
├── Gateway (1)
├── Access Control Devices (0-N)
│   ├── Gates
│   ├── Elevators
│   └── Doors
├── Units (0-N)
│   ├── Primary Tenant
│   ├── Shared Tenants
│   └── BluLok Device (1:1)
└── Statistics & Monitoring
```

## Page Architecture

**Features**:
- Tabbed interface (Overview, Devices, Units)
- Gateway status monitoring
- Device hierarchy visualization
- Unit management interface
- Real-time lock controls
- Statistics dashboard

**Cross-linking**:
- Device cards → Device details
- Unit cards → Unit management
- Gateway status → Device dashboard
- "View Facility" from all related pages

### 3. Devices Overview (`/devices`)

**Purpose**: Unified device monitoring across all facilities
**Features**:
- Grid and list view modes
- Device type filtering (Access Control, BluLok)
- Status monitoring and filtering
- Real-time lock controls
- Battery level monitoring
- Search and advanced filtering

**Cross-linking**:
- Device cards → Parent facility
- BluLok devices → Associated units
- Facility filtering integration
- Status alerts → Problem resolution

### 4. Units Management (`/units`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive unit and tenant management
**Features**:
- Grid and table view modes
- Tenant assignment visualization
- Lock status and control
- Unit filtering and search
- Occupancy tracking
- Feature and amenity display

**Cross-linking**:
- Unit cards → Facility view
- Tenant info → User management
- Device status → Device controls
- "My Units" for tenants

## Smart Cross-Linking System

### Navigation Patterns

1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clear hierarchical paths
2. **Context-Aware Actions**: Related actions based on current view
3. **Quick Links**: Jump between related entities
4. **State Preservation**: Maintain filters when navigating

### Cross-Reference Features

- **Facility Cards**: Link to devices, units, and details
- **Device Cards**: Link to parent facility and associated units
- **Unit Cards**: Link to facility, tenant info, and device controls
- **Status Indicators**: Direct links to problem resolution
- **Search Integration**: Global search with entity linking

## UI/UX Principles

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Card-Based Design**: Clean, scannable information cards
2. **Status Colors**: Consistent color coding across all views
3. **Icon System**: Intuitive icons for different entity types
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show summary, expand for details

### Interactive Elements

1. **Hover States**: Subtle animations and feedback
2. **Real-time Updates**: Live status and control updates
3. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with recovery options

### Responsive Design

1. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for all screen sizes
2. **Adaptive Layouts**: Grid/list toggles for different contexts
3. **Touch-Friendly**: Large tap targets and gestures
4. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Role-Based Views

### Admin/Dev Admin
- Full access to all facilities and controls
- Device management and configuration
- Tenant assignment and management
- System-wide monitoring and alerts

### Facility Admin
- Scoped to assigned facilities only
- Unit and tenant management
- Device monitoring and control
- Facility-specific reporting

### Tenant
- "My Units" view with assigned units only
- Lock status monitoring
- Basic unit information
- Simplified interface

## Real-Time Features

### Live Status Updates
- Device online/offline status
- Lock status changes
- Battery level monitoring
- Occupancy changes

### Interactive Controls
- One-click lock/unlock controls
- Status change confirmations
- Real-time feedback
- Error handling and retry

## Performance Optimizations

### Data Loading
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Pagination with "load more"
- Efficient filtering and search
- Cached facility data

### UI Performance
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimized re-renders
- Image lazy loading
- Skeleton loading states

## Integration Points

### API Services
- Centralized API service layer
- Error handling and retry logic
- Request/response transformation
- Authentication integration

### State Management
- Local component state for UI
- Context for global state
- Optimistic updates for controls
- Error boundary handling

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Facility usage patterns and insights
3. **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience
4. **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities
5. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search across all entities
6. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select and batch actions
7. **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable views
8. **Audit Logging**: Activity tracking and history

### Technical Improvements
1. **GraphQL Integration**: More efficient data fetching
2. **Service Workers**: Background sync and caching
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Saved filters and custom views
4. **Export/Import**: Data export and reporting
5. **Third-party Integrations**: External system connections

## Testing Strategy
